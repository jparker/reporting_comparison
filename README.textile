This Rails application compares the design and performance of different
techniques of generating aggregate reports. The methods under consideration
are:

# Denormalized reporting table maintained by ActiveRecord callbacks
# Denormalized reporting table maintained by DB (PostgreSQL) triggers
# Read-only reporting model backed by DB (PostgreSQL) view
# Methods that generate SUM queries using ActiveRecord
